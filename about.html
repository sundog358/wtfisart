            <p>Dear Digital Art Explorer,</p>
            <p>
              Welcome to the world of WTF is Art, where we explore the
              intersection of digital art, art history, contemporary American
              art, and technology. Sun & Rain Works is a contemporary art
              business, founded in April of 2005, that creates art works of
              Metaconceptual Art, or Meta Art, and promotes and encourages Art
              and Experience, and Art and Education, through modern technology
              and contemporary Meta Art, or Metaconceptual Art.
            </p>
            <p>
              "WTF is Art dot com" is a website that was originally designed and
              created by the art business Sun & Rain Works in the year 2008, as
              a contemporary art work of Metaconceptual Art, to promote,
              advertise, market, and otherwise support Metaconceptual Art, or
              Meta Art, and the auctioning of a previously undiscovered Ansel
              Adams photograph from the 1950s at Sotheby's in New York City in
              2009 as part of the Spring photographs auction sale in NYC.
            </p>
            <p>
              This photograph and the real-time live auctioning of the art
              photograph at the auction itself were in and of itself another
              Metaconceptual art work titled "WTF is Ansel Adams". This art work
              was the art auction happening itself, and coordination of
              Sotheby's with Sun & Rain Works to sell the art photograph to the
              highest bidder with accompanying Meta art works also created for
              the first time in history live at an auction at Sotheby's in NYC.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two art works, "WTF is Ansel Adams" and "WTF is Art dot com",
              are part of a larger body of work by Sun & Rain Works, and are
              intended to be seen together, as a single, cohesive body of work.
